/**
 * App authenticated-nav override.
 *
 * **Fork-owned scaffold** — Sunrise ships this `null` (= use the platform
 * default) and does NOT change this file after release, so your edits here merge
 * cleanly on upgrade (the stable contract is this file's export, not its value).
 * Treat it like the landing page: a starting point you're expected to modify.
 *
 * This is the seam that stops an app's own product from being unreachable: the
 * header a signed-in user sees. Pair it with `lib/app/auth-landing.ts`, which
 * decides where they land after login, signup, invite acceptance or email
 * verification — a nav link with no matching landing route still leaves the
 * post-login page pointing at the stock dashboard.
 *
 * Forks OWN this list, so the model is *replacement*, not append: set it to a
 * non-null `ProtectedNavItem[]` and it **replaces** the platform default
 * wholesale (remove/rename/reorder freely). Leave it `null` to keep the default.
 * To add a link while keeping the platform ones, spread
 * `DEFAULT_PROTECTED_NAV` — see the note on it about what spreading pins.
 *
 * Auto-wired: `components/layouts/protected-nav.tsx` reads `protectedNavItems`.
 * The `next/link` / active-state / admin-filtering glue stays in that platform
 * component, so `adminOnly: true` keeps working on a fork's own items.
 *
 * Boundary-clean: type-only import, so this stays within the `lib/app/**`
 * framework-agnostic boundary.
 *
